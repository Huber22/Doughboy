Thanks for buying my asset!

This shader is highly customizable, so to get nice results you need to be carefully with the settings.



1 - Dont forget specify " Mirror Reflection " script for your water mesh, the script generates a reflection map for your water shader.


2 - You need to specify three texture maps for this water shader,  please specify the texture map according to the description. Be careful, Side Water Distortion parameter requires a normal map.


3 - Here you need to understand the meaning of these following parameters:
    
     Wave Length : the crest-to-crest distance between waves in world space.

     Amplitude : the height from the water plane to the wave crest. 

     Speed : the distance the crest moves forward per second.

     Wave Number : the number of waves, it is exactly the opposite  of QO.

     QO : is a parameter that controls the steepness of the waves


4 - Due to possible compatibility issues between Unity versions, so I remove all Standard Assets from my submission. If you want a better performance, you can load Bloom and Tonemapping Color Grading scripts from the Standard Assets.
